#Black women account for 19.83 percent of the women shot, or close to 20 percent - this figure is slightly off likely due to updates in the dataframe in the four years since the article was published
#for this part, reporters likely did not do the same level of data analysis as other sections since basic Census Bureau data like this is easily accessible online. They could find the information through this page: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/dec/2020-census-demographic-profile.html#data
#filter for unarmed females

#Find number of rows excluding those with "N/A" for race (black_women_unarmed doesn't have any "N/A" values for race, but adding based on mindset that wapo reporters are working with regularly updated data)
